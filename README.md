Dyslexic Highlighter
===================

Extension for Chrome to help dyslexic people read.

I am not  an expert on dyslexia, I'm creating it the way I think it will help me, underline highlight words under the mouse to read better  :)

Work in progress, currently only proof of concept with hacky code. Made in freestyla mode!
